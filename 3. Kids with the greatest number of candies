# There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, 
# denoting the number of extra candies that you have.
# Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, 
# they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.
# Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        
        candy_boolean = []
        for candy in candies:
            extra_candy = candy + extraCandies
            if extra_candy >= max(candies):
                candy_boolean.append(True)
            else:
                candy_boolean.append(False)

        return candy_boolean
